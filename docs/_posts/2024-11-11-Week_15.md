## AMD Testing

SO: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS, RAM: 16 GB, CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS (6 cores):

| Task | Gazebo’s RTF | Gazebo’s FPS | % CPU Usage | % GPU Usage |
|------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| CPU  | 0.90         | 17           | 550%        | 11%        |
| GPU  | 1.00         | 72           | 102%        | 74%        |


### New problems

- The gazebo camera pose needs to be updated.
- The topics are duplicated.
- The reset button is not working.
- The world's landscape needs to be fixed

## RA Testing

I test again RA in D2, at the beginning the follow line exercise did not work correctly on its frontend.

## Harmonic Testing

Testing all the exercises, and looking for the problem why the topics are not working. The HAL library doesn't seem to work, nor does posting by hand in topics.

Testing of the tf topics with their respective plugins:
- They are not updated after reset.
- Problem with plugin timer.

## Solving errors

- The reset button is working.
- Improved fps of the universe.

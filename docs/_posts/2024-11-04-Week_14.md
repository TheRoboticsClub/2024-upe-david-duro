## First steps working on exercise

The topics have been modified to be specific to the name of the robot.
In RA, `HAL.py` has been updated to use these new topics and the robot works perfectly.

### New problems

- The gazebo camera pose needs to be updated.
- The topics are duplicated.
- The reset button is not working.
- The world's landscape needs to be fixed

## Solving errors

The gazebo camera pose was not modified correctly because the gazebo client and gazebo server have to be launched separately. Once the client is launched, a camera pose is configured (default) and then cannot be changed. Once discovered, the pose has simply been modified in the client.

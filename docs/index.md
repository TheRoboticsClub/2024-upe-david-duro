## Building GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a simple way to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. Follow these steps to set up your own GitHub Pages site:

1. **Create a Repository**:
   Go to GitHub and create a new repository. If you want your site to be available at `https://your-username.github.io`, name the repository `your-username.github.io`.

2. **Add Your Site Content**:
   Upload your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other files to the repository. You can do this through the GitHub web interface or by pushing from your local machine using Git.

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   Go to the repository settings, scroll down to the "Pages" section, and select the branch you want to use for your site. If your files are in a specific folder (like `docs`), select that folder.

4. **Access Your Site**:
   After a few minutes, your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name` (or `https://your-username.github.io` if you named the repository after your username).

For more detailed instructions, visit the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

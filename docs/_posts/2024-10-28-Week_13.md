## Working on harmonic

### Launching world problems
The world could not be launched for several reasons, a reserved world name was being used by gazebo. In addition, some of the resources imported by the world contained an erroneous path.


### Frontend and libraries
The frontend has been updated to be able to receive the image. In addition, the `HAL.py` and `GUI.py` programs have been updated to be able to receive information from the topics and publish in them.


### Launching robot
The robot is now launched correctly and the topics are published. Right now the robot is able to receive speeds through the program and moves perfectly.

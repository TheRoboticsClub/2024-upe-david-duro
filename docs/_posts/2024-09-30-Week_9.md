## Creating april tags in harmonic

For this part we have used the apriltags of https://github.com/koide3/gazebo_apriltag and for gazebo harmonic to understand them we have based ourselves on https://app.gazebosim.org/AndrejOrsula/fuel/models/aruco_default.

Some examples:

## Update to Monaco editor

After researching and looking for alternatives to autocomplete with the monaco editor the solutions that have been found are a bit complex. Right now monaco only supports: `json`, `html`, `css`, `typescript`,`javascript`.
Snippets have been created for functions such as for, while... function and class declarations. Example:

```js
    {
      label: "for",
      kind: monaco.languages.CompletionItemKind.Snippet,
      documentation: "Snippet for a for loop",
      insertText: "for ${1:item} in ${2:iterable}:\n\t$0",
      insertTextRules:
        monaco.languages.CompletionItemInsertTextRule.InsertAsSnippet,
      range: range,
    },
    {
      label: "while",
      kind: monaco.languages.CompletionItemKind.Snippet,
      documentation: "Snippet for a while loop",
      insertText: "while ${1:condition}:\n\t$0",
      insertTextRules:
        monaco.languages.CompletionItemInsertTextRule.InsertAsSnippet,
      range: range,
    },
    {
      label: "if",
      kind: monaco.languages.CompletionItemKind.Snippet,
      documentation: "Snippet for an if statement",
      insertText: "if ${1:condition}:\n\t$0",
      insertTextRules:
        monaco.languages.CompletionItemInsertTextRule.InsertAsSnippet,
      range: range,
    },
```

## Beta Testing

Testing of https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2749 for frontend update and effectiveness of vacuum exercises.

## Upgrading GPU usage

Here we have tried to create a script that looks for the available gpu and launches it knowing where it is located, this way it would be useful for different configurations and different users. A colleague has moved forward with the issue and so far we have been testing how it works and how to improve it.

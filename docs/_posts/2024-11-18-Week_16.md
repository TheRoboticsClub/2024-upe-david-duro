## Updating new Dockerfile

At the moment only the exercises with gazebo harmonic were working, in fact, the topics in gazebo classic were not working properly. This is due to the lack of compatibility between ROS2 Humble and Gazebo Harmonic. To solve it, we have modified the dockerfile and the robot package we have used to use some new dependencies.

Old:

```xml
<exec_depend>ros_gz_bridge</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>ros_gz_image</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>ros_gz_sim</exec_depend>
```

Updated:

```xml
<exec_depend>ros-humble-ros-gzharmonic-bridge</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>ros-humble-ros-gzharmonic-sim</exec_depend>
<exec_depend>ros-humble-ros-gzharmonic-image</exec_depend>
```

Now apparently both versions of gazebo are running at the same time.

## Creating new Frontend

For this exercise you want to show two screens to the user. One with the map containing 3 poses (real, noisy and estimated by the user) and another image with the camera image. For this we have had to modify the frontend. 

## Updating GUI-HAL

More GUI keys have been added to send more messages to the frontend (all poses). Also everything has been simplified as before it was using a GUI and a generic HAL extracted from vacuum-cleaner.

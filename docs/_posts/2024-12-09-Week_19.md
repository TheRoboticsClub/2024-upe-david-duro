## Fixed timeout error

In the past, we were looking for a process called `gzclient`, the problem is that this name is only valid for gazebo classic. This caused the process not to be found resulting in a timeout error. The new name was found to be `gz sim` and has been fixed.

## Killed harmonic process

There seems to be a bug with gazebo harmonic where open processes are not properly killed by its simulation. This blocked future simulations with either classic or harmonic. To solve it, all processes opened by the simulation are searched and killed.

## Fixed odometry

The `gz-sim-diff-drive-system` plugin calculates the position of the robot based on the sent velocities without taking into account possible collisions. When the robot crashed, the assumed position was still modified. The plugin `ignition-gazebo-odometry-publisher-system` has been added, this plugin does use the real position provided by gazebo.

## Updating frontend

There were some problems with displaying the image and these have been corrected. The way of showing the robots has been modified, now with an icon that shows the orientation and viewing angle. Fixed the algorithm for switching from gazebo coordinates to image pixels.
